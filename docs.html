            <h2>The Replit Development Environment</h2>
            <p>Go from idea to a full-stack app in minutes. With Replit, you can create and publish applications right from your browser with AI at your fingertips—no installation or setup required.</p>
            <p>Building apps traditionally requires installing programs, languages, and packages, which is a time-consuming setup process. The Replit platform configures your environment instantly, so you can start building immediately, whether you’re a beginner or an experienced developer. Each task runs in a fresh virtual machine, which installs dependencies and makes changes based on your prompt. You can provide setup scripts to ensure your project builds and tests correctly.</p>
            <p>When you run code, it’s executed in a secure, cloud-based virtual machine (VM) with internet access. This gives you powerful tools to test, build, and debug in context. However, it’s important to treat the environment with the same security precautions you would for any public or shared compute surface.</p>
