            <p>Choose between two distinct build approaches to match your development style and project needs.</p>
            <p>When you submit your initial prompt to create an app, Agent creates a feature list based on your request. You’ll then see the question “How do you want to continue?” with two build options:</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Agent build mode selection interface showing 'Build the full app' and 'Start with a design' options</div>
            <p>You can also choose to “continue planning” if you want to refine the feature list before building begins.</p>

            <h3>Start with a design</h3>
            <p>Perfect for seeing visual results first:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quick design phase:</strong> Agent creates a clickable front-end prototype in ~3 minutes</li>
                <li><strong>Visual-first approach:</strong> See how your app will look and feel before building functionality</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible continuation:</strong> Press “Build functionality” to have Agent complete a full working version of your app</li>
                <li><strong>User-controlled pacing:</strong> You decide when to move from visual prototyping to a finished application</li>
            </ul>
            <p>After the design phase, you’ll see options to continue:</p>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Interface showing 'Keep iterating on design' and 'Build functionality' options after design phase</div>

            <h3>Build the full app</h3>

        <section id="checkpoints">
            <h2>Checkpoints</h2>
            <div class="image-placeholder">Agent checkpoint with interactive map and rollback options</div>
            <p>A checkpoint is a comprehensive snapshot of your Replit App that captures completed work from Agent, including workspace contents, AI conversation context, and connected databases. Agent creates meaningful checkpoints when it finishes implementing your request, ensuring you only pay for completed functionality.</p>

            <h3>How checkpoints work with effort-based pricing</h3>
            <p>Agent’s new effort-based pricing creates checkpoints that reflect the actual work performed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>One checkpoint per request:</strong> Agent bundles all work for your request into a single, meaningful checkpoint</li>
                <li><strong>Variable pricing:</strong> Simple changes cost less, while complex builds cost more based on the effort required</li>
                <li><strong>Transparent costs:</strong> Each checkpoint shows exactly what you’re paying for that completed work</li>
                <li><strong>No intermediate billing:</strong> You’re not charged for Agent’s thinking or planning process</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each checkpoint lets you perform the following actions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Rollback:</strong> Undo changes made by Agent and return to the state of the previous checkpoint, including workspace contents, AI memory, and connected databases</li>
                <li><strong>Track usage:</strong> Hover over the usage icon in a checkpoint to view the amount billed for that checkpoint</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For comprehensive details about what checkpoints capture and how rollbacks work across your entire development environment, see <a href="#">Checkpoints and Rollbacks</a>.</p>
            <p>Agent uses effort-based pricing where you pay based on the complexity and scope of your request. Simple changes typically cost less than complex builds. Initial planning and proposal stages are free - you only pay when Agent implements approved changes. <a href="#">Learn more about Agent billing</a>.</p>

        <section id="best-practices">
            <h2>Getting the most from Agent</h2>

            <h3>Best practices for prompts</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Be specific: Describe exactly what you want your app to do</li>
                <li>Provide context: Include relevant files, URLs, or examples</li>
                <li>Start simple: Begin with basic functionality and add complexity gradually</li>
                <li>Use examples: Show Agent similar apps or features you want to emulate</li>
                <li>Choose your mode thoughtfully: Consider your timeline, certainty about requirements, and development style</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Managing costs effectively</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Start with free planning: Review Agent’s implementation plan before approving work</li>
                <li>Use simple requests: Break complex projects into smaller, focused tasks</li>
                <li>Set spending limits: Configure usage alerts and budgets to control costs</li>
                <li>Monitor usage: Track checkpoint costs to understand pricing patterns</li>
            </ul>
