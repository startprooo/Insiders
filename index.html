                <h3>Longer Run Time</h3>
                <p>Run. Run. Done. Agent handles full tasks autonomously. It understands your aspiration with simple prompts in natural language. Once you give it instructions, it will go work autonomously for hours, giving you time back. You can track your projectâ€™s progress, in real time, from anywhere, with Live Monitoring right on your phone.</p>

            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Self-Testing</h3>
                <p>Test. Fix. Retest. Agent tests its work, makes improvements, and tests again. It constantly improves your application behind the scenes in a reflection loop. Our proprietary testing system is up to 3x faster and 10x more cost-effective than traditional models.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="feature">
                <h3>Agent Generation</h3>
                <p>Automate. Delegate. Accelerate. For the first time ever, Agent can build other agents and automations. That means you can automate complex and repetitive workflows using natural language. You can then interact with your own Agents by integrating them into platforms like email or Slack. The net outcome is an increase in your efficiency and productivity.</p>
